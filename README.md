# DWSim-X-NEQSim

This repository contains a collection of process models that are initially developed and simulated in **DWSim**, a powerful graphical chemical process simulator. These models cover a range of processes such as phase separation, compression, distillation, and more, utilizing various thermodynamic packages and components.

The goal of this repository is to replicate these DWSim process simulations in **NEQSim**, a Python-based library for thermodynamic and process calculations. By replicating the DWSim models in NEQSim, we are able to cross-verify the results between the two platforms. This approach ensures that the simulations are accurate, reliable, and consistent across different tools.

Each process in DWSim is carefully reconstructed in NEQSim by:
- Defining the same chemical components and fluid properties.
- Using identical thermodynamic models (e.g., Raoult‚Äôs Law, SRK, Peng-Robinson).
- Replicating the temperature, pressure, and flow rate conditions.
- Performing calculations for phase equilibrium, vapor-liquid separation, and other key outputs.

After the simulations are run in both DWSim and NEQSim, the results are compared to validate key process parameters such as:
- Vapor and liquid flow rates.
- Phase compositions.
- Temperatures and pressures.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for engineers and researchers who seek to validate and verify their process models across different simulation environments, ensuring higher confidence in the accuracy of their process design and optimization work.
